        Military service has shaped and influenced generations of America's most
        influencial and powerful storytellers. From Pulitzer prizes to
        blockbusters, these artists draw inspiration from their experiences in
        the military and often have something meaningful to communicate--an
        urgent message to their fellow countrymen.

        Unfortunately, many returning veterans struggle to find stability,
        belonging, and economic self-sufficiency. And it seems sort of silly to
        dedicate your time to writing your masterpiece when you're struggling to
        survive.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a tradegy. Combat veterans possess the unique insight and
        literary potential that a faltering America needs now more than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mission of Veteran Artist Residencies is to tap into that potential
        by providing a space where promising post 9/11 combat veterans can live
        free from survival concerns and focus solely on their art.

      <h2>The Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Between 2020 and 2023, the Veteran Artist Residencies non-profit intends
        to support four veterans by offering each a five-month fully-paid artist
        residency in beautiful and inspiring Humboldt County, California.
      </p>
      <p>What type of artists are we looking for?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Novelists.</li>
        <li>Memoirists.</li>
        <li>Poets.</li>
        <li>Screen play writers.</li>
        <li>All forms of writing will be considered.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        During the application process, we look for potential and ambition. A
        lot can be accomplished in five months, and we want our veteran artists
        to show up ready to immerse themselves in their artistic endeavors.
