        The truth is, the depth of emotional and psychological experiences
        experienced in war create some of the most perceptive, sensitive, and
        human story tellers our country has ever known.
      </p>
      <p>
        But returning veterans often struggle to find stability, belonging, and
        economic self-sufficiency. And it seems sort of silly to dedicate your
        time to writing your masterpiece when you're struggling to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a tradegy. Combat veterans possess the unique insight and
        literary potential that a faltering America needs now more than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mission of Veteran Artist is to tap into the squandered potential by
        providing a space where aspiring post 9/11 combat veterans can live free
        from survival concerns and focus solely on their art.
      </p>

      <p>
        This organization provides paid artistic residencies to post-9/11 combat
        veterans. Your donations go directly toward veteran artist living
        stipends.
      </p>

      <p>

      <h2>The Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Between 2020 and 2023, the Veteran Artist Residencies non-profit intends
        to support four veterans by offering each a five-month fully-paid artist
        residency in beautiful and inspiring Humboldt County, California.
      </p>
      <p>What type of artists are we looking for?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Novelists.</li>
        <li>Memoirists.</li>
        <li>Poets.</li>
        <li>Screen play writers.</li>
        <li>All forms of writing will be considered.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        During the application process, we look for potential and ambition. A
        lot can be accomplished in five months, and we want our veteran artists
        to show up ready to immerse themselves in their artistic endeavors.
