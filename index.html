    <h2>The Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Between 2020 and 2023, the Veteran Artist Residencies non-profit intends
      to support four veterans by offering each a five-month paid artist
      residency and a free place to live.
    </p>
    <p>What type of artists are we looking for?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Novelists.</li>
      <li>Memoirists.</li>
      <li>Painters.</li>
      <li>Poets.</li>
      <li>Screen play writers.</li>
      <li>All art forms will be considered.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      During the application process, we look for potential and ambition. A lot
      can be accomplished in five months, and we want our veteran artists to
      show up ready to immerse themselves in their artistic endeavors.
