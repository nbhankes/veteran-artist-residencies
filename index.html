            "Vonnegut is a moralistic novelist but one who employs humor to
            drive home his ethical points. In many respects he most closely
            resembles Mark Twain not only in being a highly ethical novelist,
            but also in his use of comedy. His books serve a remarkable range of
            purposes: social commentary, theological discussion, ethical
            argument, parody, satire, and prophecy. His work reflects his strong
            belief in the dignity and worth of all individuals, and as an
            American pragmatist, he reminds his readers again and again of the
            unfinished nature of America." -Donald Morse

        The truth is, the depth of emotional and psychological experiences
        experienced in war create some of the most perceptive, sensitive, and
        human story tellers our country has ever known.
      </p>
      <p>
        But returning veterans often struggle to find stability, belonging, and
        economic self-sufficiency. And it seems sort of silly to dedicate your
        time to writing your masterpiece when you're struggling to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a tradegy. Combat veterans possess the unique insight and
        literary potential that a faltering America needs now more than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mission of Veteran Artist is to tap into the squandered potential by
        providing a space where aspiring post 9/11 combat veterans can live free
        from survival concerns and focus solely on their art.
      </p>

      <p>
        This organization provides paid artistic residencies to post-9/11 combat
        veterans. Your donations go directly toward veteran artist living
        stipends.
      </p>

      <h2>The Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Between 2020 and 2023, the Veteran Artist Residencies non-profit intends
        to support four veterans by offering each a five-month fully-paid artist
        residency in beautiful and inspiring Humboldt County, California.
      </p>
      <p>What type of artists are we looking for?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Novelists.</li>
        <li>Memoirists.</li>
        <li>Poets.</li>
        <li>Screen play writers.</li>
        <li>All forms of writing will be considered.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        During the application process, we look for potential and ambition. A
        lot can be accomplished in five months, and we want our veteran artists
        to show up ready to immerse themselves in their artistic endeavors.
